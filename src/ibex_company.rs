/// - _Full name_: this is the full legal name of the company. Optional.
/// - _Short name_: This is the usual name for the company, usually some sort of contraction
///   of the _full name_.
/// - _Ticker_: the identifier of the company in the market.
/// - _ISIN_: the _International Securities Identification Number_.
/// - _NIF_: a local identifier for Spanish companies. This is optional as some companies,
///   which are included in an Ibex index, might be registered in another country.
